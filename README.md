# Feature-Selection-on-Breast-Cancer-Dataset
Within the field of machine learning, feature selection is a crucial aspect of model building. This involves the process of choosing a subset of important features from the original data. The goal of this is to improve the model's performance, reduce the risk of overfitting, and potentially accelerate the model training speed.

In this notebook, we will explore various common techniques for feature selection. To illustrate these methods, we will use the breast cancer dataset from the scikit-learn library. This dataset is commonly used for breast cancer classification and serves as a good example for practicing feature selection techniques.
